Refresh Rate Checker <p>
This is a simple python script that lets you set a preferred refresh rate and will check every 60 seconds to make sure your refresh rate is set to what you like. Currently there is a crash when saving preferences so the script restarts itself if compiled into an exe, or it has to be run again if ran from terminal.
